# Microsoft Digital Defense Report Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Microsoft Digital Defense Report (2020-2024)** using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**. By combining **ChromaDB** and **LangChain**, the system retrieves relevant context from the reports and uses **phi-3.5** to generate actionable insights on significant security threats. The analysis aims to identify emerging risks and support enhanced strategic decision-making.
