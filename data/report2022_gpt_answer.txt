The **Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2022** identifies the following as the top significant security threats:
1. **Ransomware and Extortion**: Increasingly audacious attacks targeting critical infrastructure, governments, and businesses with human-operated ransomware and double extortion tactics.
2. **Credential Phishing**: Persistent rise in credential theft schemes targeting individuals and businesses indiscriminately, with Microsoft 365 credentials as a primary target.
3. **Cybercrime as a Service (CaaS)**: Growth of ecosystems offering tools for phishing, malware, and ransomware, lowering the barrier to entry for cybercriminals.
4. **Nation-State Threats**: Sophisticated cyberattacks from actors like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea targeting critical infrastructure and espionage.
5. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: Exploitation of dependencies in software and hardware, including IoT and operational technology (OT), as entry points.
6. **Hybrid Workforce Security Challenges**: Increased attack surface from remote and hybrid work environments, including compromised VPNs and endpoints.
7. **IoT and OT Exploitation**: Attacks leveraging unsecure IoT devices and industrial control systems to disrupt operations or gain network access.
8. **Cyber Influence Operations**: Nation-states using disinformation campaigns to sway public opinion, destabilize democracies, and propagate propaganda.
9. **Rapid Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: Attackers exploiting unpatched systems at a faster rate, emphasizing the importance of timely updates.
10. **Cryptocurrency Abuse**: Criminals increasingly using cryptocurrency for transactions, laundering, and ransom payments, complicating law enforcement efforts.
These threats highlight the need for strong cybersecurity measures, including Zero Trust principles, advanced threat detection, and collaboration between public and private sectors.
