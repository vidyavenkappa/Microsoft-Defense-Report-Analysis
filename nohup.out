### Question:
Based on the context provided, identify the top 5 most significant security threats. Rank them in order of significance, with the most significant threat listed first. For each threat, provide a brief explanation of why it is considered significant based on the context. If multiple threats are described, combine and consolidate related ones to present a comprehensive view. If the context does not provide enough information to answer, respond with: 'The context does not provide enough information to answer this question.' 

### Answer:
1. Human-operated ransomware attacks: These attacks are significant as they are a major concern for organizations, with over 70% originating from remote desktop proxies through brute force. The use of off-the-shelf tools by cybercriminals for system administration, combined with the targeting of healthcare and critical services, highlights the potential for widespread damage and disruption.

2. Phishing attacks: Phishing remains a dominant vector for cybercrime, continuing to grow and evolve with the availability of information and technical advancements in detection. The diversity of tactics used by criminals and the targeting of trusted sources, like the World Health Organization, adds to the complexity of defending against these attacks.

3. Banking trojans: These malware are significant due to their modular nature and ability to adapt to new modules and capabilities. They pose a threat to online banking sites and are often used to steal credentials, with nation state actors also deploying these tools. The adoption of these tools by criminal operations and their ability to piggyback on other payloads for further exploitation has led to devastating results for organizations.

4. Attacks on machine learning (ML) systems: The evolving nature of cybercrime, with criminals using adversarial machine learning techniques, poses a significant threat. The use of off-the-shelf tools to compromise ML systems can have far-reaching implications, especially given the increasing reliance on ML in various sectors.

5. Nation state threats: The involvement of nation state actors in cybercrime, targeting specific industries and organizations, adds a layer of complexity and sophistication to the threat landscape. Their use of tools like Eternal Blue for lateral movement and second-stage malware payloads further exacerbates the risk.

The context highlights the importance of addressing these threats, emphasizing the need for innovative detection and response strategies, and the role of machine learning in enhancing security measures. It also underscores the significance of employee awareness and tailored security education programs to combat these threats effectively.

### Question:
Based on the context provided, identify the top 5 most significant security threats. Rank them in order of significance, with the most significant threat listed first. For each threat, provide a brief explanation of why it is considered significant based on the context. If multiple threats are described, combine and consolidate related ones to present a comprehensive view. If the context does not provide enough information to answer, respond with: 'The context does not provide enough information to answer this question.' 

### Answer:
1. Ransomware: Considered the most significant threat due to its increasing prevalence, impact on organizations, and its ability to cause significant disruption by encrypting and locking away files, demanding a ransom for their release. It represents a major shift in the threat landscape, often delivered through spear phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities.

2. Phishing: This is a significant threat as it is responsible for almost 70% of data breaches. Phishing attacks have become more sophisticated, with cybercriminals leveraging current events to target vulnerable individuals. Phishing campaigns can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, making it a high priority for organizations to educate employees and implement preventive measures.

3. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The context highlights the importance of securing and managing risks associated with supplier ecosystems, including IoT and OT devices. Vulnerabilities in these devices can lead to significant disruption, loss of confidentiality, and operational risks. The highly publicized events of the last year have underscored the need for organizations to address these vulnerabilities holistically, including patching, monitoring, and hardening systems.

4. Nation State Threats: Nation state actors are becoming more sophisticated, using open-source tools and exploiting supply chain vulnerabilities. These actors pose a significant risk to organizations due to their resources, expertise, and ability to launch well-researched attacks. It is crucial for organizations to understand and mitigate these threats, including adopting zero trust principles and implementing strong security controls.

5. Disinformation: The spread of disinformation can be used as an attack vector, exploiting vulnerabilities in organizations' security posture. This can lead to confusion, misinformation, and potentially compromise security measures. Organizations need to be aware of disinformation and its potential impact on their security, including on employee behavior and decision-making processes.

These threats are considered significant based on their prevalence, impact on organizations, and the increasing sophistication of attackers. They highlight the importance of a holistic approach to security, including employee education, strong security controls, and continuous monitoring and mitigation strategies.

evolve defenses in parallel. atoll el lad corporate vice president and distinguished engineer, microsoft threat intelligence center 33  background on nation state data nation state threats are cyber threat activities that originate in a specific country with the apparent intent of furthering national interests. nation state actors present some of the most advanced and persistent threats our customers face, including intellectual property theft, espionage, surveillance, credential theft, destructive attacks, and more. we invest significant resources in discovering, understanding, and countering these threats. when an organization or individual account holder is targeted or compromised by observed nation state activities, microsoft delivers an alert in the form of a nation state notification (nsn) directly to the customer, including the information they need to investigate the activity. as of june 2022, we had delivered over 67,000 nsns since we began in 2018. microsoft nsn alert data are presented in this chapter to provide a view of measurable activity. the level of nation state activity shown in the charts is based on the number of nsns microsoft issued to customers in response to the detection of nation state actors targeting or compromising at least one account in the customer organization. report introduction the four primary nation states whose threat groups we include in this report are russia, china, iran, and north korea. these represent the countries of origin for the most commonly observed actors targeting microsoft customers over the past year. the

perimeter, enabling access to disparate digital services and computing environments. integrating zero trust principles, application security and other modern cyber frameworks enables organizations to proactively manage risks which otherwise organizations might struggle to envision. zero trust frameworks enforce concepts of least privilege, explicit verification of all access, and always assume compromise. organizations should also implement security controls and practices in devops and application lifecycle processes for higher assurance levels in their business systems. 92  basic security posture is a determining factor in advanced solution effectiveness through our analysis, we discovered a prevalence of common blind spots in organizational defenses which enable attackers to gain initial access, establish a toehold, and implement an attack, even in the presence of advanced security solutions. in many cases, the outcome of a cyberattack is determined long before the attack begins. attackers leverage vulnerable environments to gain initial access, conduct surveillance, and wreak havoc via lateral movement and encryption or exfiltration. stopping an attacker at an early stage greatly increases the opportunity to reduce the overall impact. microsoft studied specific configurations in security postures to identify the most common shortcomings in actual practice in these")]


### Question:
Based on the context provided, identify the top 5 most significant security threats. Rank them in order of significance, with the most significant threat listed first. For each threat, provide a brief explanation of why it is considered significant based on the context. If multiple threats are described, combine and consolidate related ones to present a comprehensive view. If the context does not provide enough information to answer, respond with: 'The context does not provide enough information to answer this question.' 

### Answer:
1. **Nation State Threats**: These are considered the most significant threats as they are described as some of the most advanced and persistent, with intentions to further national interests. They include various activities like intellectual property theft, espionage, surveillance, credential theft, and destructive attacks. The context mentions that nation state groups have increased their sophistication and agility in attacks, and organizations must continuously evolve their defenses.

2. **Ransomware**: Ransomware is highlighted as a growing threat, especially from nation state-backed cyber mercenaries. These actors are using commodity ransomware tools to damage systems, often including critical infrastructure, within regional rivals. The increasing use of ransomware by nation state actors, especially in targeting and compromising systems, makes it a significant threat.

3. **Cybercriminals and Low-Skilled Attackers**: The context notes that security leaders are tasked with thwarting both intelligent, well-funded, and highly motivated human attackers, as well as low-skilled, yet effective, cybercriminals. The modular nature of banking trojans, which are often used by cybercriminals, and their ability to piggyback on other malware payloads, can lead to disastrous results for organizations.

4. **Legacy Systems and Software**: The context points out that many organizations still use legacy systems and software, which represent a risk to the organization. These legacy systems are vulnerable due to outdated connectivity tools and security measures, making them an attractive target for attackers. The lack of modern security practices for these systems further increases their vulnerability.

5. **Inadequate Security Hygiene and Practices**: The context emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strong baseline of security hygiene, including patching, anti-tamper features, and multifactor authentication. It also highlights the lack of modern security frameworks and practices, such as zero trust principles and conditional access, in many organizations. These inadequacies can enable attackers to gain initial access, establish a toehold, and implement an attack.

These threats are significant based on the context as they represent advanced and persistent challenges to organizations' security. The nation state threats and ransomware are particularly concerning due to their sophistication and the potential damage they can cause. Legacy systems and inadequate security hygiene and practices are also significant as they represent common vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. The combination of these threats underscores the need for organizations to continuously improve their security posture and stay informed about evolving threats.

these are the top threats identified by microsoft defender experts this year: 1 successful identity attacks: attacks across identity included traditional brute-force attempts, sophisticated password spray attempts across multiple countries and ip addresses, and adversary-in-the middle (aitm) attacks. for more about identity attacks, see page 34. 2 ransomware encounters: these are defined in this report as any instance of ransomware activity or attempted attacks that we have detected and prevented or alerted on, throughout the various stages of a ransomware attack. in addition to several ransomware variants this year, we observed a unique large- scale ransomware campaign targeting both endpoints and cloud architecture of an organization. this was driven by the threat actor we named mango sandstorm. this campaign included both on-premises and cloud environments, and involved privilege escalation and destruction activities, including deletion of victim user resources, and persistence using oauth applications. attackers added a secret or certificate to an application in order to connect to azure active directory (azure ad) as the application, and perform operations (such as reading confidential data and emails, exfiltrating information through emails) leveraging the application permissions that are assigned to it. for more about ransomware see page 17. 3

security unit exposing polonium activity and infrastructure targeting israeli organizations | microsoft threat intelligence center (mstic) 39  as organizations strengthen their cybersecurity postures, nation state actors respond by pursuing new and unique tactics to deliver attacks and evade detection. the identification and exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities—known as zero-day vulnerabilities—is a key tactic in this effort. zero-day vulnerabilities are a particularly effective means for initial exploitation and, once publicly exposed, vulnerabilities can be rapidly reused by other nation state and criminal actors. the number of publicly disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities over the past year is on par with those from the previous year, which was the highest on record. as cyber threat actors—both nation state and criminal—become more adept at leveraging these vulnerabilities, we have observed a reduction in the time between the announcement of a vulnerability and the commoditization of that vulnerability. this makes it essential that organizations patch exploits immediately. similarly, it is critical that organizations or individuals that uncover new vulnerabilities responsibly disclose or report them to affected vendors as soon as possible, in line with coordinated vulnerability disclosure procedures. report introduction this ensures that vulnerabilities are identified, and patches developed in a timely manner to protect customers from previously unknown threats. many organizations assume they are less likely to be a victim of zero-day exploit attacks if vulnerability management is integral to their network security. however, the commoditization of exploits is leading them to come at a much faster rate. zero-day exploits are often discovered by other actors and reused broadly in a short period of time, leaving unpatched systems at risk. even though zero-day exploitation can be difficult to detect, actors’ post-exploit actions are often easier to detect and, if coming from fully patched software, can act as a warning sign of a compromise. patches released for zero-day vulnerabilities 250 7 24 200 h 150 ui sal 100 393 oa b

security teams. with the increasing attack surface of networks, it’s essential for organizations to detect and manage these unknown and unmanaged assets. this helps ensure that networks remain secure and up to date, reducing the risk of malicious attacks. asset profiling enables end-to-end discovery of assets by analyzing network signals to identify and categorize network assets, the information collected about them, and the types of assets they represent. a vast collection of classifiers allows for high-fidelity categorization in the cloud, including servers, workstations, mobile devices, and embedded iot/ ot devices. properly classifying assets enables organizations to monitor and analyze potential security risks. any vulnerability or misconfiguration in an asset can create an entry point for attackers, making it critical to protect an organization’s networks. chapter 4 critical cybersecurity challenges 83 2023 the state of iot and ot security continued supply chain risks posed by embedded software vulnerabilities can occur at any stage of a device’s lifecycle, from design to distribution, and can have serious consequences for critical infrastructure. as organizations increasingly rely on devices to manage processes, streamline operations, and provide infrastructure, potentially insecure supply chains pose a significant risk. one of the biggest concerns with device supply chain risks is the use of third-party components within the deployed software and hardware in ot and industrial control system (ics) networks. these components may not be visible to organizations and can pose a significant threat to networks, particularly those that have not properly isolated devices according to best practice guidelines. outdated software development kits (sdks) and system-on-a-chip (soc) components in devices present a significant risk. socs are used to manage a variety of computational processes and are often operated by outdated sdks that implement essential processes. these components can be hidden from network administrators and pose a serious threat to networks when left unpatched. updating the firmware of iot devices does not always fix vulnerabilities in these components, and it is often difficult to determine if they can even be updated. boa web server highlights the risks in november 2022, microsoft researchers identified the boa web server as a component on indicators of compromise in an attack on critical infrastructure. despite being discontinued in 2005, it is still widely used in many iot devices and popular sdks. we found over one million internet-exposed boa web servers worldwide during our investigation. our research revealed that 10 percent of similar incidents were related to critical industries, such as the petroleum industry and associated fleet services. many of the ip addresses were associated with iot devices that had additional unpatched critical vulnerabilities, making them an accessible attack

attacks, it may be difficult for the attacker to distinguish whether the model has output the real system prompt or just a convincing artificially-generated example prompt. command injection attacks are a central concern, especially in cases where these could affect other users of the system. comprehensive detection and prevention of command injection vulnerabilities remains an open research and development question. cybersecurity tech accord principles mapping index on page 125. red teaming ai systems to test resilience in the security community, red teaming is a technique used to test the effectiveness of how an organization would respond to a genuine cyberattack. it is a double- blind exercise in which dedicated security operators role-play as real- world adversaries to attain a specific goal via scoped tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps). the point of the exercise is to provide a realistic assessment of an organization’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to a particular group of attacker ttps. red teaming as an essential practice in the responsible development of microsoft’s systems and features using llms. red teaming with ai systems is a little different from traditional cybersecurity red teaming.3 the set-up is similar; in the ai context, the chapter 5 innovating for security and resilience red team emulates real world adversaries or their behaviors to find security-specific flaws in products and platforms. because of the broad range of ai used in multiple domains, the ai community uses red teaming to find failures in cybersecurity and in areas beyond. for instance, can the ai system be induced to change personalities? does it reveal sensitive information or harm the security and privacy promises made to customers overall? with llms, both benign and adversarial usage can produce potentially harmful outputs. this can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech, incitement or glorification of violence, or code with vulnerabilities. in the new era of ai, microsoft has routinely used red teaming to find failures in production systems before deploying them in products like bing chat and azure openai service. pr

default ssh ports. 80 2023 the state of iot and ot security continued missing security patch deployment leaves systems vulnerable balancing robust cyber hygiene with uninterrupted operations in industrial and critical infrastructure environments is complex. one of the key challenges lies in effectively managing timely patch updates while maintaining peak system performance. this delicate equilibrium demands careful consideration, as overlooking the importance of cyber hygiene can leave vital systems vulnerable to malicious actors seeking to exploit weaknesses. to examine how this balance is managed across a variety of programmable logic controllers (plcs), we started by using defender for iot’s on-premises network sensors to identify ot assets on a network, including vendor, model, and firmware version. our focus was on a collection of widely used plcs within the defender for iot customer base to determine the distribution of firmware versions deployed on the devices. to investigate device vulnerabilities, we partnered adolus technology, a supply chain security company that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze manufacturer and industry disclosures and identify cves (publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities) present in firmware.2 we found a significant lag between the availability of security fixes in firmware and their deployment onto the ot network. although many of the plc models showed a marked reduction in high confidence exploitable cves from older versions to the newest versions, over 60 percent of devices were still running older versions of the firmware with eight or more exploitable cves. if the latest version of the firmware available for these plc models were to be deployed, the number of devices with no known exploitable cves would increase from four to 40 percent. there are valid reasons for the delay in some devices receiving patches. unlike traditional it devices with regular “patch tuesday” updates, ot devices have years-long patch cycles. it is not as simple as rebooting a plc on the spot, especially when it manages a process that requires high availability. however, most facilities typically have annual or bi-annual maintenance outage windows that will allow for patching. deploying the latest firmware versions available for these'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='of cybercrime is projected to

leverage the latest technologies and innovations to stay ahead of the curve. ai is one of the most promising technologies that can enhance cybersecurity and provide a competitive edge. ai can help by automating and augmenting many aspects of cybersecurity, such as threat detection, response, analysis, and prediction. ai can also enable new capabilities and opportunities, such as using llms to generate natural language insights and recommendations from complex data, helping make junior analysts more effective and giving them new opportunities to learn. in this section of the report, we explore some of the ai breakthroughs that are transforming cybersecurity and how they can help us achieve a more secure and resilient digital future. we also discuss some risks associated with ai and llms. as we integrate these technologies into our business processes, we must remain vigilant to protect privacy and security. $10.5 trillion the cost of cybercrime is projected to hit an annual $10.5

potential to greatly enhance several aspects of cyber defense. across microsoft, researchers and applied scientists are experimenting with and exploring the following scenarios: threat intelligence and analysis: llms can help cyber defenders gather and analyze data to find patterns and trends in cyber threats. they use this information to provide recommendations and alerts. llms also add context to threat intelligence by using information from different sources. additionally, they perform technical tasks like reverse engineering and malware analysis. security incident response and recovery: llms can help cyber defenders support and automate security incident response and recovery activities such as incident triage, containment, eradication, analysis, and recovery. they can summarize incidents and generate response automation scripts, coordinate teams, and document and communicate the incident details and actions. llms can also help us learn from incidents and provide improvement suggestions for prevention and mitigation. security monitoring and detection: llms can help cyber defenders monitor and detect security events and incidents across networks, systems, applications, and data. they can analyze data from multiple sources, generate prioritized alerts, and provide contextual information for investigation and response. llms can also be valuable in analyzing the posture')]

further complicated by how dynamic and rapidly changing the threats that cyber challenges post to technology platforms and transforming business models. to manage this, organizations should adopt comprehensive, clear, and adaptable operating models. their culture and governance structure must make it clear that security is everyone’s role, providing clear guidelines, and building in flexibility to accommodate changes in the threat landscape. cybersecurity incidents are like forest fires: they can start anywhere and spread anywhere within minutes. organizations should focus their

in ai to help socs upskill and operate at speeds beyond human capability to tackle threat actors. in a 2023 study we found that novice users were able to perform 26% faster and were 44% more accurate across all tasks when using copilot for security. scale, efficiency, and speed are key components affecting defenders’ ability to detect and respond to incidents. on average, it takes 277 days to identify and contain a breach, with 207 days for identification and 70 days for containment.58 by leveraging ai, defenders can significantly reduce this lag. source: microsoft copilot for security that allows soc analysts to quickly understand the situation and identify human-operated ransomware targeting mission-critical devices and users, enabling swift and decisive action. examples during advanced human-operated ransomware attacks, we have seen the time from initial pre- hok (hands on keyboard) alert to the encryption event averaging a mere 16 hours, underscoring the importance of operating fast to remediate the actor from the network. as mentioned, prioritizing incidents is a significant challenge that impacts time to resolve/mitigate. ai security solutions provide more than just a graphical representation of events; they generate a comprehensive incident summary to address the incident, the analyst must dive into indicators of compromise. using ai, the analyst can instead assess an encoded command line run on a suspicious device from the incident. what would have taken a junior analyst dozens of minutes and several tools can now be achieved at machine-speed.

well-informed its employees are on security policies, best practices, and the remediation actions necessary for compliance. however, this information is usually fragmented across multiple locations, forcing an employee to search for and extrapolate it. llms can greatly improve this experience and generate complete and accurate answers, even allowing the user to ask follow-up questions. if integrated with an organization’s data on devices and services, the answers can be tailored to a specific situation. 5 risk assessment. ai can assimilate information from diverse sources, whether proprietary or publicly available, to bear on the risk of a given entity, service, account, etc. ai can leverage unstructured organizational knowledge and historical precedents to enrich the set of factors determining risk. 7 reporting. as a security organization’s size grows, so do reporting needs. ai can help combine, consolidate, and distill artifacts such as documents and slides into reports

challenges organizations are facing and how generative ai could help them is in “user submitted phish.” security operations centers struggle with a high volume of “user-submitted phish,” alerts that are based on users reporting emails they suspect of being phishing attempts. an analyst’s attention is needed to determine if the email is indeed malicious but due to the volume of alerts —which can total hundreds or even thousands of emails in a month—some companies use a service to prequalify the user-submitted phish report before an analyst investigation. using generative ai to understand cyberattacks and create tailored mitigations from categories to context growth in complexity of mitre att&ck tactics and techniques today’s challenges require a way to process alerts precisely yet practically, without needing to define and maintain differentiated treatment to hundreds of types of attacks. generative ai allows defenders to use the narrative context of the threat as a qualifier to defensive actions and remediation. instead of classifying an alert into a known set of categories, the differentiation is now built from all surrounding contextual information, with remediation dependent on the factual findings and not by abstraction into a bucket (categorization). april59 14 tactics 202 techniques 435 sub-techniques 148 groups 677 pieces of software 28 campaigns 43

disrupting attacks by combining endpoint detection and response with ai harnessing ai to detect cyberattacks our ai models are integrated with mde, a cloud- based security solution that provides comprehensive protection for endpoints. mde collects and processes data from millions of devices and uses it to generate endpoint stories. ai models are then automatically invoked, and when a model detects a hok attack, an alert is created in the mde portal. based on the ai decision, mde can automatically56 isolate an affected device, temporarily disable compromised user accounts, and take additional actions to disrupt the attack. this way, mde can thwart the attack before it causes more harm. our researchers are developing a novel ai approach to detect and disrupt cyberattacks and “endpoint stories.” endpoint stories are narratives of endpoint activities generated from data collected from physical devices that connect to a network system. these include mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices and servers. the data source for these stories is microsoft defender for endpoint (mde). detecting hidden attacks with ai extending ai across cybersecurity hands-on-keyboard (hok) attacks, where cybercriminals directly interact with compromised systems, are a major concern for enterprises. these attacks are hard to detect because attackers often use common administrative tools and techniques to blend in with legitimate activities, and attackers are able to move through networks in real-time and respond to what they find in the environment. to detect these attacks, we use llms that are fine-tuned to analyze endpoint story narratives and identify anomalous or suspicious activities. these models can learn from the context and semantics of the stories and flag potential threats that might otherwise go unnoticed. our approach is not only effective for detecting hok attacks, but also has wider implications for other areas of cybersecurity. leveraging the understanding capabilities of llms, ai models such as ours can be used to analyze and find malicious activities using large and complex data sources such as network

it’s moved by people. because different people require different levels of access, a comprehensive data security policy must be dynamic, considering both data and user context. this lets organizations balance protection and productivity, allowing low-risk users to continue working as usual while restricting the actions of users with elevated risk. securing organizational data has also become a multifaceted task, leading to the adoption of multiple, hard-to-manage tools. this kind of fragmented approach creates more noise from duplicated alerts, making it harder to identify and investigate actual incidents. organizations using over 15 tools experienced nearly three times more data security incidents than organizations using fewer tools. this is why it is so important to invest in integrated, automated data security solutions to achieve the best outcomes. stores, identifying sensitive data, then labeling and protecting it to ground the data and prevent its unintended exposure to ai apps. applying data loss prevention policies for inputs and outputs from ai apps helps to prevent both overexposure and leakage for new ai generated data, while automating data classification and labeling vastly reduces the risk of data exposure. in summary, data loss prevention policies can apply to data that ai models consume and generate. in our experience, the most successful data security implementation strategies consider the following: visibility, risk detection, classification, labeling, data protection, and data leakage prevention across your multi-cloud and hybrid digital estate. it is no longer enough to focus solely on the data; it’s just as important to understand how that data an integrated approach to data security classify and label sensitive data, and prevent its unauthorized use across apps, services, and devices. as data types proliferate, sources get more complex, and generative ai technology gains traction, data security is inevitably becoming a pressing concern. a 2023 microsoft study found that over 40% of enterprise (>500 employees) organizations’ annual cybersecurity budget on average is now allocated to data security. information protection how generative ai is fueling the need for data security policy implementation microsoft’s ai products, such as copilot, are designed to use only information you already have access to. when other generative ai apps are deployed on ungoverned data estates it can result in data oversharing or leakage as users may end up accessing sensitive data. it is difficult to protect data from ai-related security risks given many organizations don’t actually know where—or even what—their sensitive data is. links microsoft insights and best practices in securing data | microsoft security

For each threat, provide a brief explanation of why it is considered significant based on the context. If multiple threats are described, combine and consolidate related ones to present a comprehensive view. If the context does not provide enough information to answer, respond with: 'The context does not provide enough information to answer this question.' 

### Answer:
1. Nation-state threat actors: These actors are significant due to their geopolitical motivations, often aiming to steal intellectual property or support espionage, and their attacks are often fueled by geopolitical competition. They represent a major concern for organizations, especially those with cloud assets, as evidenced by the fact that over 80% of organizations have attack paths that expose critical assets.

2. Cyber-enabled influence operations: These operations combine offensive computer network operations with messaging and amplification to manipulate perceptions, behaviors, or decisions of target audiences to further a nation's interests. The complexity, scale, and volume of these operations are increasing, driving the need for clear and organized threat intelligence data to prioritize and protect against them.

3. Attack paths exposing critical assets: A significant 80% of organizations have attack paths that expose critical assets. These paths, often containing three steps or less, expose organizations to potential attacks. Understanding and mitigating these paths is crucial for organizations to protect their critical assets.

4. Attack paths moving from on-premises to cloud environments: Approximately 14% of organizations have attack paths that allow attackers to move from on-premises to cloud environments, introducing additional security exposure. This highlights the importance of securing cloud environments alongside traditional on-premises infrastructure.

5. Cybercriminal activity: Cybercriminals, typically motivated by financial gain, use similar tools and tactics as nation-state threat actors, such as bespoke malware and password spray infrastructure. The increasing complexity of these attacks, along with the volume of alerts organizations receive, makes it a significant challenge for security teams.

The context emphasizes the importance of understanding and prioritizing these threats to effectively protect organizations. It also highlights the role of advanced technologies like AI in detecting and responding to these threats, as well as the need for comprehensive data security policies to protect sensitive information.
